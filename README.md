# GSoC-cBioPortal
Source code containing the proof of concept implementation of an Interactive web tour across cBioPortal.<br>

The <em>portal</em> folder goes right inside the cBioPortal's root folder i.e wherever your <strong>$PORTAL_HOME</strong> points to.


<strong>Update</strong> : I did not get in GSoC 2017. The mentors appreciated my proposal and my efforts, but decided to drop my project idea all together due to the very limited number of projects they could select. Nonetheless, the whole thing was a great learning experience for me.

For anyone who might be interested in what my proposal looked like, here's a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yB2gKsnQiraENW7-YsAymLyIfB7VSJYz7U--fhLdBKc/edit?usp=sharing">link</a> to it.
